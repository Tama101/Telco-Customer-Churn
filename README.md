# Telco Customer Churn - Project Overview

Telco customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a telecommunications company. It is a critical issue for telecom providers as it directly impacts their revenue and customer base. To better understand and address customer churn, analyzing various factors and identifying patterns can be crucial.

In this analysis, we will explore a dataset containing relevant features that provide insights into customer churn. The dataset includes information such as customer demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen status, partner, dependents), service-related details (e.g., tenure, phone service, internet service), and customer behavior (e.g., online security, device protection, streaming services). Additionally, it includes billing information (e.g., contract type, paperless billing, payment method) and financial data (e.g., monthly charges, total charges).

By examining these features, we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that may contribute to customer churn. The analysis will provide valuable insights into the factors influencing customer decision-making, the effectiveness of certain services or features in retaining customers, and the impact of billing and payment preferences on churn rates.

Understanding these aspects of customer churn can enable telecom providers to make data-driven decisions, implement targeted retention strategies, and optimize their service offerings. By proactively addressing the factors contributing to churn, telecom companies can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce customer attrition, and strengthen their competitive position in the market.
